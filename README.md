## Exercise

Once the activity starts, you try to `ping google.com`...but wait! It doesn't work.

```
ping: google.com: Name or service not known
```

Oh no!

Dig around and see if you can fix it so that ping can actually hit `google.com`.

When you can see:

```
PING google.com (142.250.187.238) 56(84) bytes of data.
```

Then you've fixed it!
